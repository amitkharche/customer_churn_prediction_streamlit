# Customer Churn Prediction

## Executive Summary
This project simulates a real-world telecom scenario to predict customer churn using machine learning. It demonstrates how a data science solution can reduce churn rates, improve retention, and drive business value.

## Business Problem
Telecom companies lose millions annually due to customer churn. By identifying customers likely to leave, proactive retention strategies can be deployed. The business goal is to increase customer lifetime value and reduce acquisition costs.

## Approach
This project follows an end-to-end data science lifecycle:
1. Business Understanding
2. Data Acquisition & Cleaning
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Feature Engineering
5. Model Development
6. Evaluation using classification metrics
7. Business Interpretation & Deployment Planning

## Dataset
- A synthetic dataset is used here to replicate the structure of real-world customer churn data.
- Features include usage behavior, service subscriptions, and account data.

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC AUC

## Estimated Business Impact (Simulated)
- Potential reduction in churn by 12–18%
- Estimated $500K–$750K annual savings (based on industry benchmarks)
- Targeted retention campaigns improve ROI by 3x

## Project Artifacts
- `churn_data.csv`: Synthetic dataset
- `churn_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with full workflow
- `model_output/`: Sample results and visualizations
- `deployment_plan.md`: Notes for operationalization

## Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git for version control

## Author Notes
This project represents a leadership-oriented data science engagement with storytelling, impact focus, and deployability in mind. It is designed for showcasing strategic data science capabilities.
